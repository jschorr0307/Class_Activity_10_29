## Example
Create an empty graph and a full with 10 vertices. Then count the vertices and edges and check if verticies 1 and 3 are connected using the **igraph** package. 
```{r}
#install.packages("igraph")     Install the igraph package
library(igraph)                 #Load the package 

#Create the graphs
e <- graph.empty(n = 10)
f <- graph.full(n = 10, directed = FALSE)
f2 <- graph.full(n = 10, directed = TRUE)

#Plot the graphs
#The vertex.label.dist argument controls how close your label is to the vertex
#The main argument allows you to give your graph a title
plot(e, vertex.label.dist = 3, main="Empty Graph")

par( mfrow=c(1,2) )       #Allows you to plot your graphs side by side
plot(f, vertex.label.dist = 3, main="Undirected")
plot(f2, vertex.label.dist = 3, main="Directed")


#Count the vertices 
vcount(e)
vcount(f)

#Count the edges
ecount(e)
ecount(f)

#Checks if vertices 1 and 3 are connected
are.connected(e, V(e)[1], V(e)[3])
are.connected(f, V(f)[1], V(f)[3])
```
